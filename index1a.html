          I was called. I do not know where it came from, but somehow my body knew how to follow it. I followed it. I listened to the voice all the way to the sea. It lapped at my toes in an ominous warning. However, the omnipresent voice drew me further. It was cold, and it was dark. The night was quiet except for the waves beating against the soft sand. I had been here before, and during the day the sand held warmth that burned your soles. Now, the sand cooled the space between my toes. Another step further and the water raised bumps on my skin that seemed to transcend through my body and send chills through my bone marrow. I kept going. Soon, my lips touched the ocean. My mouth secretly cherished the salt I licked off my lips. It filled my mouth, it filled my nose, and then it filled my lungs. My eyes burned as they were surrounded, until I could not see. My hair swayed with the tides. My body wanted to struggle, but the voice calmed me and I allowed the brine to replace my oxygen. Suddenly, my vision returned. A new macrocosm was introduced to me. Organisms that the marine biologists could never dream about, appeared before my eyes. There were also many young girls. They seemed to be living, but they had an almost empty look in their eyes. I ran up to one, in search of questions. She looked at me and pulled me behind her. It was not until then, that I noticed we were in a line. One by one we entered a large sunken ship. I asked her what was happening, but the fear and confusion in her eyes answered it all for me. To load onto the boat, we walked along the backs of turtles that seemed to enjoy their participation. There were men on board. They too seemed to have little to no idea of what was occurring. Nobody knew what was happening, but they continued with their work. I walked along the splintered shells to enter the ship. Inside was hollow, except for barrels lining the wall. The girl in front of me stopped in front of a barrel and put her hand against it. Within seconds, any emotion from her body was shortly wiped out. It was my turn. My instincts told me, no, but my hand took full autonomy for itself, and my palm reached the aged wood. Through the cracks in the timber, I watched my body walk away. It was void of emotion. It was now apparent to me, my soul was trapped in this cask indefinitely, and I watched my barren body walk away from me quietly.

          The sound of the music box filled the room, as she felt her carpet embrace her face. The music box had been a family heirloom, passed down from her great grandmother. The soft notes stopped abruptly, and the spring holding the ballerina upright limped slightly. A rush of fear washed over me, as I fretted over how to tell my mother that this beloved antique was broken.  My brother’s room sat adjacent to mine, and I knocked on his door in search of aide.  After quite a bit of persuasion, he drove me to his math teachers home. His teacher was an older gentleman who often dabbled in repair of antiques. Nervously, I knocked on his door and explained my plight to him. Graciously, he offered to look it over and return it to my brother when it was fixed. I was allayed and continued about my day. That evening as I prepared myself for bed, I felt a strange ache in my toes. I dismissed it and continued on to my slumber. I woke up, and glanced over at my clock. It was two in the morning. The pain in my toes was excruciating, and it continued up through my calves. I got up and almost immediately collapsed in agony. My bones throbbed, and as I took a closer look at my feet I noticed that they were bejeweled with large blisters. I dragged myself to the drawer in my rose colored bathroom that had an ointment for blisters. It brought temporary relief, but shortly after the ache was back with vengeance. I writhed in agony on the cold-tiled floor. The torment continued to increase, and soon my stomach began to feel unrest. I reached my hand down to attempt to settle it. My scalp began to burn, as if it had been pulled back tightly for an extended period of time. My fingers glided across the top of my head, and found nothing wrong. My thighs began to burn as though I had overexerted them. I tried to reach them to massage them, but my hands would not budge. It was most likely due to shock, and I used my foot to apply pressure to my thigh. As soon as my skin touched, it morphed together. I was stuck, and within a blink of an eye I was lost too. Only my eyes could move, and I glanced up at the dark ceiling covered in pipes. A musty smell surrounded the room and the surface on which I laid on felt like cold splintered timber. A hand moved towards me, and I then understood that size had been warped. Either this man was incredibly large, or I was incredibly small, but his hand wrapped around my frame. He used a knife to tear my clothes off of me, and then began to dress me in light pink garments. I tried to struggle, but a disconnect between my brain and my body did not allow this. In the midst of my horror, I managed to recognize the clothing that he dressed my exposed body in. It was the outfit that my little ballerina in a box wore. My spine felt a sharp twinge as he twisted the spring through it, but my body was beginning to go numb and I found the physical pain bearable. Mentally, I was exhausted as I realized what was occurring. This man was placing me in the box, and would soon close the lid to my autonomy. Surely, they would notice me missing, and go in search for me. I tried to calm myself down with affirmations of my family’s attentiveness. It was dark. I heard a young girl speak with the older man.

       “Are you sure she is kin?”

       “Yes, otherwise my chant would not have worked.”
       <br>
     <br>
     “And I have to live with them?”

       Do you want to raise suspicion in her family?”
       <br>
     <br>
     “She is a doll, there is no way they would ever imagine that.”
     <br>
     <br>
     <a class="indented">
       "I did my job, it is your job now to make the family pay.”

      I listened to her soft footsteps walk away from the man and increase in volume as she approached the box that held me. The light was bright and blinded my vision momentarily. I watched as she grabbed the tube of resin, dipped the brush in it, and glossed it over my cornea. It was dark. I could not see and hoped that the rest of my senses would also be destroyed. However, I heard the slam of the box, and knew that I would be subjected to an eternity of unrest.

         The smell of coffee beans rushed through my nose. The plate scalded my wrist as I carried it. My pinkie was overextended holding the carafe. Half and Half splashed on my apron. Expo slipped bacon onto the plate. The kitchen sang and danced in Spanish. Mallory made a racket as she sorted silverware. Drew complimented it with the sound of ice hitting itself and the plastic. The restaurant filled with chaos, clunking, and chatter. I showed up and fell into place and somehow with all the turmoil each day seemed to end up with well-roasted potatoes, chocolate turtle lattes, and the cheesiest grits you could ask for.
